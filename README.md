"The Moses Experience" By "The Red Sea-Sharp"

## Introduction

This was a group project done for Andrew Park's 2022 CMPT401 Course (Special Topics: VR). We were inspired to make a cool VR game with a low poly look. Everyone put in a tremendous amount of effort to make a noteworthy if simple VR game that anyone can have a look at and enjoy.

## Build

There are instructions [here](https://github.com/LordUbuntu/red-sea-vr/tree/main/Assignment%20Resources/Instructions%20(Setup%20%26%20Navigation)). It can also be set up and built by hand by taking the project file "Moses Project", which is a unity project, and building or developing it by hand.

## Details

### Team

We named ourselves "The Red Sea-Sharp" as a play on words to what our chosen topic would be about (crossing the red sea).

The team consisted of:
- Jared Klassen
- Melissa Buist
- Kieran Clarke
- Jacobus Burger

## Technology

The game was made with Unity Engine, primarily targeting the Occulus Quest 2 (only device available to us), using Unity's XR packages.

## Thoughts

* It was great to work with a team of energetic and lively people who were as passionate as I was.
* Though the game is simple, it is great to see how far we've come.
* It was fun.
* I hope to have more opportunities like this in the future.
* I hope I'll be something.
