"The Moses Experience" By "The Red C#"

## Introduction

This was a group project done for Andrew Park's 2022 CMPT401 Course (Special Topics: VR). We were inspired to make a cool VR game with a low poly look. Everyone put in a tremendous amount of effort to make a noteworthy if simple VR game that anyone can have a look at and enjoy.

## Details

### Team

We named ourselves "The Red C#" as a play on words to what our chosen topic would be about.

The team consisted of:
- Jared Klassen
- Melissa Buist
- Kirin Klassen
- Jacobus Burger

## Technology

The game was made with Unity Engine, primarily targeting the Occulus Quest 2 (only device available to us), using Unity's XR packages. 

## Thoughts

* It was great to work with a team of energetic and lively people who were passionate about what they did.
* Though the game is simple, it is great to see how far we've come.
* It was fun.
* I hope to have more opportunities like this in the future.
